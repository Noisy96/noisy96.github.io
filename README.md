## Description
A website that groups links to my profiles... basically! I mean I got too many.

## Libraries
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* AOS
* Line Icons
* Slick Carousel

## Future enhancements
* Move "contact" from the navbar to a button next to resume.
* Make the email listed at the end easy to copy (click to copy).
* Throw everything out and start all over again eventually.
